# Cookly

Cookly is an Web App designed to prove that AI can be helpful in the kitchen. 

## What can Cookly do?

Cookly can connect to your Ollama server and be able to generate recipes using Artificial Intelligence. 

## Why Cookly?

You can use Cookly to finally remove that chicken that is almost expired or use Cookly to experiment what chef's call acceptable! I aspire to improve the Cookly program to achieve the goal of having AI in the kitchen standing side by side with you.

## Social with Cookly?

I plan on adding social features such as taking photos of the recipes you have successfully made with Cookly.

## Moderation

TODO: Add the ability to moderate the Cookly instance.
